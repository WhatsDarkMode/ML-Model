<h1 align="center">Football Machine Learning Model</h1>
<h3 align="center">This project started off as a data collection exercise, seeing which players won more games than others, it was a curiosity. Each week the teams are mixed up but always with the aim of making the teams even, if this was truly achieved the final result should be a draw. Therefore, we can assume that if Team 1 loses it is because someone in their team did not contribute to the team in the way we had thought they would when the teams were drawn - because we thought the teams were even and hence the sum of all the player skills of team 1 was equal to that of team 2. I then explored this through 1 metric, win %, an ideal world didnt happen so we didnt get draws but nonetheless, you'd expect players to have 50% wins and 50% losses and we're trying to make the teams even each week and therefore a player will end on the winning side as much as the losing side if we achieve that (over a long course of weeks). So, if a player has a low win % (i was using a limit of <35%) this means that player is consistently underperforming relative to our opinion of their skill - that is distinct from them being bad, they could be very good but we think they're Messi skill level which means when we check the teams we balance it based on our eprceived skill level of that player... Or this player is really unlucky and ended up on the wrong side of that 50/50 win/loss split more times than they should have.</h3><br><br>

<h3 align="center">Investigating all this made me curious as if i could create something that could be given the week's teams and predict the score - this way an unbias tool could be used to verify the teams are fair prior to the match happening. This led me to create this Machine Learning Model, it is my first attempt at Machine Learning so it is a big learning curve. My model is far from flawless and I am exploring ways of improving it - please check the issues to see the improvement points im working on. </h3>
