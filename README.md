<h1 align="center">Football Machine Learning Model</h1>
<h3 align="center">I first coded during my undergradute, i wasn't very good and i didnt like it either. Fast forward 3 years and during my 2nd year on the Lonza Graduate Scheme i had gained a new interest in coding through work so began teaching myself outside of work. I used LeetCode to practise SQL and Codecademy to practise Python. Coding is now one of my passions, its problem-solving in its rawest form, and i've combined this with another passions of mine, football, and I'm in the process of creating a Machine Learning model that can predict the outcomes of my football matches before they've even happened.</h3>
